# KernBot.io

KernBot.IO is a GlyphsApp plugin that will improve your productivity and save you time during the metric spacing and kerning phases of your font development workflow.

Out of the box, KernBotIO displays an interface aiming to center your focus on the space between your letterforms. GlyphsApp is a fantastic tool, but it emphasizes the current glyph and does not give justice to the context surrounding your glyph-shapes. KernBotIO re-centers the space between your letterforms, allowing you to quickly view any letter combination that uses your chosen kerning pair combination.

KernBotIO helps you by displaying lists of all the kerning-keys within your font. It then lists every letter and all possible letter combinations that utilize the selected kerning-key-pair. It also makes use of optional buttons to display your kerning in context, including a spacing string sequence maker, a word generator, and even more under-development!
